## Common-Review-4: Attack with limited DA (Reviewer B & C)

In this table we present the attack accuracy and TPR@1%FPR of TIMIA when the size of $D_A$ is small. In particular, we assure that
 $|DA|/|D_T|\in[1\%, 2\%, 3\%$, assuring that $|D_A|$ is smaller than 30. For each target we pick 6 reference samples, which takes 20\% of $D_A$.
